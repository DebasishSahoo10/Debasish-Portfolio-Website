        <h2>Feed suggestion helps</h2>
        <p>One day I was surfing my twitter and catching the geopolitical news as I have a good intrest in them. I saw one tweet from Tanay Pratap in my feed. He twitted something about web devloping. I went ahead and surfed his twitter profile a bit and gave him a follow (at that time I had no idea that this man is going to be my coding mentor).</p>
        <h2>Got nod from a Familiar name</h2>
        <p>Later that day I was watching a stream of Prakhar Gupta and someone in his chat asked him about a coding question and he replied - </p>
        <p class="code"> <em>“Man I have no idea about it. You should go and ask Tanay Pratap about it. He is the perfect person to answer this”</em></p>
        <p>And I am someone who belives that Prakhar Gupta’s words are worth a follow. That is how my brain got a confirmation that Tanay Pratap is great at whatever he does. Then I started reading and liking more tweets from Tanay Pratap. <em>(At that moment I had no idea that Tanay Pratap is just not great but he is the MS Dhoni of it.)</em></p>
        <h2>My twitter got developer-fied</h2>
        <p>Slowly my feed started getting tweets from more and more developers and I kinda liked the language they were using to put their development brain out. Then I got to know about <b><em>neoGcamp</em></b> and <b><em>roc8</em></b> and read a lot people who got great results out of them. This got me more intrested into coding world. I went ahead with all my curiosity and researched all about it and got all the details and doubt cleared.</p>
        <h2>And here I am</h2>
        <p>Cut to December 2021 I decided to start level zero of neoGcamp but due to my exams it got postponed to Feb 2022 and here <strong>I am on third lecture of level one.</strong> <em>(to tell you guys a secret : I am loving it)</em></p>
